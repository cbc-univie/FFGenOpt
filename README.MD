FF_GenOpt was developed and tested on Debian with Linux kernel 4.9. It is written in Python and works with Python 3.6+. It consists of multiple modular components which can be adapted for other fitness functions and use cases. 

**Requirements**

The program requires a Python interpreter with numpy and matplotlib. The fitness computation modules requires scipy and either a CHARMM installation or the OpenMM module.

**Architecture**

The program consists of multiple files which have to be in the same directory.

FF_GenOpt.py contains the core module, genetic algorithm, random search algorithm, log management, population management, and parameter management.

FF_GenOpt_conf.py contains the configuration file management.

FF_GenOpt_fitness.py wraps the fitness function which depends on the file below.

FF_GenOpt_extern.py contains modified code from AFMM and Florian JÃ¶rg (from the Department of Computational Biological Chemistry at the University of Vienna) for calculating the fitness function. The plugin for normal mode calculation using OpenMM has been taken from https://github.com/Hong-Rui/Normal_Mode_Analysis

**Configuration**

FF_GenOpt uses configuration files that can be created and edited in any editor. The configuration files contain the execution command for the MD software, the path to input files and output files, the optimization algorithm settings, and the parameter names, type, range, and initial values. Similar to Python, comments can be added by using \# in the beginning. A typical configuration file is shown below:

EXTERN describes whether an external MD program (i.e. CHARMM) should be called to calcuate the normal modes

PSF, CRD, PARAMS and VARFILE are required only if EXTERN is False. They point to the psf, coordindates and to the parameters with variables and explicit parameters, respectively.

MDEXEC is the executable for the MD normal mode calculations.

MDINP points at the CHARMM input file (used only if EXTERN is True), which contains all commands for reading the force field parameters, computing the normal modes with vibran, and must point at the same file as PARAM_FILENAME (which is rewritten each time the fitness function is computed).

MDOUT contains the output of CHARMM and is only used to compute the fitness function.

QMOUT contains the output of Gaussian or Psi4 with the QM-calculated normal modes. This file should not change during the optimization.

POPULATION_FILENAME contains the current population with all parameters, fitness values, the vibrational frequencies, and a small CHARMM script for setting the best set of parameters (on top). This file is rewritten after each generation, which enables the user to stop the algorithm at any time and take the best results.

LOG_FILENAME contains the log file. It can be used to track and analyze the behavior of the algorithm with the current settings.

POPULATION_SIZE defines the maximum population size. A large population covers a large parameter search space, but the initial convergence is usually slower. High-dimensional problems have larger search spaces and require larger populations than low-dimensional problems. If the population is too small, the population diversity will shrink quickly and computation effort will be wasted on generating new population members. If the population is too large, computation time will be wasted on optimizing a vast number of population members, especially in the beginning.

GENERATIONS is the maximum number of generations to be computed. This number is an upper limit and should not be too small to prevent premature computation stops. Note that computation time and convergence speed per generation can vary significantly and comparing generational progress is not always useful.

MUTATIONS_PER_GENERATION is a suggestion for the number of crossover and mutation operations per generation. It is also used to control the number of attempts of the random search algorithm. The actual number of mutations and accepted new population members will differ between each generation.

STEP_SIZE is used exclusively by the random search algorithm and defines the component-wise maximum step size when computing a new direction vector. If this value is too small, the search algorithm wastes a lot of computation time with small steps and might get stuck in a small local minimum. If this value is too large then the idea of finding local descending directions by using the negative vector will fail often. For smooth high-dimension problems a smaller step size is preferable. However, the force field fitting problem does not have such a smooth surface. A value of 0.05 seems to be a good compromise. In this case at most 5\% of the valid search range for each parameter will be used. It should be noted that this particular parameter is important and should be optimized if the performance is insufficient.

CROSSOVER_BLX, CROSSOVER_SBX, and CROSSOVER_UNIFORM define the probability for choosing either of the crossover operators per mutation operation in the genetic algorithm. The sum of all probabilities must be 1.0 or the program will fail. BLX and SBX are also parametrized, but the settings are fixed in code.

MINIMUM_IMPROVEMENT is a parameter for the random search that defines the minimum relative fitness improvement per step. This parameter is not as important as others, but it prevents wasting computation time on practically irrelevant improvements. 0.01 means that the improvement must be at least 1\%, but the value can be much smaller.

MINIMUM_DIVERSITY is a parameter that prevents the algorithm from getting stuck in fruitless computations after all population members converged to the same values. Instead of stopping the algorithm here, a new initial population is created but the population member with the best fitness is retained. This value can also be relatively small, e.g. around $10^{-5}$.

Finally, the PARAMETER keyword is used to define the parameter names and parameter type as well as the minimum, maximum, and original values. Genetic algorithms are designed for searching wide parameter ranges, but narrowing the parameter range down will lead to faster results.

**Population files**

Population files are generated at the end of each new generation and consist of three parts: All population members with their respective fitness value, the QM vibrational frequencies (multiplied by the QM factor of 0.957) and MM vibrational frequencies in absolute values and as a ratio (for the candidate with the best fitness), and the CHARMM script for setting the parameters of the population member with the best fitness.

Example population file for OAc-:

**Log files**

When starting an optimization process, the parameter settings are written into the log. The log is in TSV format and can be parsed easily by Excel-like tools or programming languages for analysis and plotting. A new line with 11 columns is appended after each generation. Example log file:

```
Gen	BestF	MeanF	TEvals	GEvals	REvals	t	t/eval
15	61.53	94.68	3092	1883	1209	1558.78	0.50
16	48.35	86.30	3201	1991	1210	1617.76	0.51
17	41.80	83.07	3313	2102	1211	1679.63	0.51

Delta	Improv	Divers
0.00	0.00	582.28
13.19	0.00	2639.27
6.55	0.00	345.59
```


The Gen column shows the current generation number. BestF and MeanF represent best fitness and mean fitness of the respective generation. GEvals and REvals show the number of function evaluations triggered by the genetic algorithm and by the rest of the algorithm (e.g. random search). TEvals is the sum of both. t is the total passed computation time in seconds while t/eval is the average time per evaluation. Delta is the improvement since the last generation, Improv is the improvement per evaluation, and Divers is the estimated diversity of the population.

**Running FF_GenOpt**

After creating the configuration file and setting up CHARMM inputs, the program can be started with

`python3 FF_GenOpt.py configuration_file.cfg`

It can be stopped by killing the process or keeping Ctrl+C pressed. Multiple sessions can be run at the same time remotely via the Linux tool tmux.

**Slicing**

The axis-parallel curve visualizations are created by a simple tool named GridSlicer. It is based on the first version FF_GenOpt and uses the same configuration files. However, it requires different files to avoid interference with the optimization process and requires additional parameters.

`python3 GridSlicer.py im1.cfg im1/im1.inp /dev/shm/im1.log im1/im1.log im1/parameters.str im1/ 50 21`

The parameters are: configuration file, CHARMM input file, CHARMM output file, log file, CHARMM force field parameters file, image output path, number of focus points (a point that all curves cross), number of computations per curve per dimension. The number of dimensions can be added as an additional parameter to cut down computation time for testing purposes. The output files are in PNG format.
